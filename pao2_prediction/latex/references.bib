abstract={BACKGROUND: The estimation of arterial blood gas and lactate from central venous blood analysis and pulse oximetry [Formula: see text] readings has not yet been extensively validated. METHODS: In this multicentre, prospective study performed in 590 patients with acute circulatory failure, we measured blood gases and lactate in simultaneous central venous and arterial blood samples at 6 h intervals during the first 24 h after insertion of central venous and arterial catheters. The study population was randomly divided in a 2:1 ratio into model derivation and validation sets. We derived predictive models of arterial pH, carbon dioxide partial pressure, oxygen saturation, and lactate, using clinical characteristics, [Formula: see text], and central venous blood gas values as predictors, and then tested their performance in the validation set. RESULTS: In the validation set, the agreement intervals between predicted and actual values were -0.078/+0.084 units for arterial pH, -1.32/+1.36 kPa for arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure, -5.15/+4.47{\%} for arterial oxygen saturation, and -1.07/+1.05 mmol litre(-1) for arterial lactate (i.e. around two times our predefined clinically tolerable intervals for all variables). This led to âˆ¼5{\%} (or less) of extreme-to-extreme misclassifications, thus giving our predictive models only marginal agreement. Thresholds of predicted variables (as determined from the derivation set) showed high predictive values (consistently >94{\%}), to exclude abnormal arterial values in the validation set. CONCLUSIONS: Using clinical characteristics, [Formula: see text], and central venous blood analysis, we predicted arterial blood gas and lactate values with marginal accuracy in patients with circulatory failure. Further studies are required to establish whether the developed models can be used with acceptable safety.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) is revolutionizing anesthesiology research. Unlike classical research methods that are largely inference-based, ML is geared more towards making accurate predictions. ML is a field of artificial intelligence concerned with developing algorithms and models to perform prediction tasks in the absence of explicit instructions. Most ML applications, despite being highly variable in the topics that they deal with, generally follow a common workflow. For classification tasks, a researcher typically tests various ML models and compares the predictive performance with the reference logistic regression model. The main advantage of ML lies in its ability to deal with many features with complex interactions and its specific focus on maximizing predictive performance. However, emphasis on data-driven prediction can sometimes neglect mechanistic understanding. This article mainly focuses on the application of supervised ML to electronic health record (EHR) data. The main limitation of EHR-based studies is in the difficulty of establishing causal relationships. However, the associated low cost and rich information content provide great potential to uncover hitherto unknown correlations. In this review, the basic concepts of ML are introduced along with important terms that any ML researcher should know. Practical tips regarding the choice of software and computing devices are also provided. Towards the end, several examples of successful ML applications in anesthesiology are discussed. The goal of this article is to provide a basic roadmap to novice ML researchers working in the field of anesthesiology.},

abstract={The alveolar gas equation is used to calculate alveolar oxygen partial pressure as it is not possible to collect gases directly from the alveoli. The equation is helpful in calculating and closely estimating the PaO2 inside the alveoli. The variables in the equation can affect the PaO2 inside the alveoli in different physiological and pathophysiological states. Alveolar Gas Equation PAO2 = (Patm - PH2O) FiO2 - PaCO2/RQ. Patm is the atmospheric pressure (at sea level 760 mm Hg), PH2O is partial pressure of water (approximately 45 mm Hg). FiO2 is the fraction of inspired oxygen. PaCO2 is partial pressure of carbon dioxide in alveoli (in normal physiological conditions around 40 to 45 mmHg). RQ is the respiratory quotient. The value of the RQ can vary depending upon the type of diet and metabolic state. RQ is different for carbohydrates, fats, and proteins (average value is around 0.82 for the human diet). Indirect calorimetry can provide better measurements of RQ by measuring the VO2 (oxygen uptake) and VCo2 (carbon dioxide production). RQ = amount of CO2 produced/amount of oxygen consumed At sea level, the alveolar PAO2 is: PaO2 = (760 - 47) 0.21 - 40/0.8 = 99.7 mm Hg. The 3 major variables of the equation are the atmospheric pressure, amount of inspired oxygen, and levels of carbon dioxide. Each has an important clinical significance and can help explain different physiological and pathophysiological states.[1]},

In layman terms, compliance is the ease with which an elastic structure can be stretched. Compliance is, therefore, basically a measurement of the elastic resistance of a system. Pulmonary compliance (C) is the total compliance of both lungs, measuring the extent to which the lungs will expand (change in volume of lungs) for each unit increase in the trans-pulmonary pressure (when enough time is allowed for the system to reach equilibrium) [1]. It is one of the most important concepts underpinning mechanical ventilation used to manage patient respiration in the operating room (OR) or intensive care unit (ICU) environment. To better understand pulmonary compliance, certain terminologies should be briefly reviewed. The following formula is used to calculate compliance:},

The current study aims to validate a novel mathematical expression for accurate prediction of the fraction of inspired oxygen that will result in a targeted arterial oxygen tension in non-smoking and smoking patients receiving mechanical ventilation following open heart surgeries. One hundred PaO2-FiO2 data pairs were obtained from 25 non-smoking patients mechanically ventilated following open heart surgeries. One data pair was collected at each of FiO2 of 40, 60, 80, and 100{\%} while maintaining same mechanical ventilation support settings. Similarly, another 100 hundred PaO2-FiO2 data pairs were obtained from 25 smoking patients mechanically ventilated following open heart surgeries. The utility of the new mathematical expression in accurately describing the PaO2-FiO2 relationship in these patients was assessed by the regression and Bland-Altman analyses. Significant correlations were seen between the true and estimated FiO2 values in non-smoking (r2 = 0.9424; p < 0.05) and smoking (r2 = 0.9466; p < 0.05) patients. Tight biases between the true and estimated FiO2 values for non-smoking (3.1{\%}) and smoking (4.1{\%}) patients were observed. Also, significant correlations were seen between the true and estimated PaO2/FiO2 ratios in non-smoking (r2 = 0.9530; p < 0.05) and smoking (r2 = 0.9675; p < 0.05) patients. Tight biases between the true and estimated PaO2/FiO2 ratios for non-smoking (-18 mmHg) and smoking (-16 mmHg) patients were also observed. The new mathematical expression for the description of the PaO2-FiO2 relationship is valid and accurate in non-smoking and smoking patients who are receiving mechanical ventilation for post cardiac surgery.},

abstract={A rapid, simple method for predicting the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) at any fractional concentration of inspired oxygen (FIO2) is presented. The method is based on a nomogram interrelating PaO2, arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) and FIO2, allowing rapid determination of the arterial to alveolar oxygen tension ratio a/A PO2. The applicability of the nomogram and its reliability for predicting the PaO2 at any FIO2 were studied prospectively in nine consecutive patients requiring mechanical ventilation (16 trials). On each occasion, a desired PaO2 was chosen and from the nomogram an FIO2 expected to yield this PaO2 was administered. The PaO2 was then measured. Actual PaO2 differed from desired PaO2 by a mean of 2.6 mm Hg (range 0 to 10 mm Hg, standard deviation (SD) 4.8). Retrospectively, we analyzed the nomogram's ability to predict the PaO2 +/- 9.6 mm Hg (2 SD) at varying FIO2. The overall sensitivity of this method was 85 percent (126 predictions out of 149 trials). We conclude that appropriate levels of supplemental oxygen can be rapidly and reliably chosen using the nomogram in selected patients.},

abstract={The purpose of this investigation was threefold: (1) could the perfusionist accurately estimate oxygen transfer (VO2/minute) while on CPB; (2) could this estimate, and its position on the oxygen transfer slope (OTS), predict resultant PaO2 values within a specific range; and (3) could previously derived performance 'normals' be used during this study. Fifty-four sets of samples (both arterial and venous) from 27 oxygenators were used in this study. Each oxygenator provided one normothermic and one hypothermic set of samples. In 48 of the 54 samples (88.9{\%}) the predicted VO2/minute was within +/- 10{\%} of the actual VO2/minute. Thirty-nine of these 48 (81.25{\%}) had resultant PaO2 values within our target range of 140 +/- 30 mmHg. The PaO2 for these 39 samples ranged from 110 to 168 mmHg with a mean of 133 mmHg. The percentage of predicted shunt (POPS) ranged from 59.0 to 192.4{\%} with a mean of 109.3{\%} (SD = 23.81{\%}). With this degree of variability, we concluded that the perfusionist must assess VO2/minute as well as POPS in order to predict the resultant PaO2.},

pages={73-78},
abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hyperoxic inspired gas is essential for patients with hypoxic respiratory failure; it is also suspected, however, as a contributor to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury. Several recent studies in humans, animals, and cell culture have identified mechanisms by which hyperoxia may exert deleterious effects on critically ill patients. This review identifies relevant new findings regarding hyperoxic lung injury in the context of providing guidance for future clinical studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have clarified the roles of both receptor-mediated and mitochondrial cell death pathways in experimental hyperoxic lung injury. Studies in animals demonstrate that hyperoxia interacts with mechanical stretch to augment ventilator-induced lung injury. Finally, studies in humans implicate hyperoxia in impairment of host defense responses to infections. SUMMARY: Although hyperoxia has not been conclusively identified as a clinically important cause of lung injury in humans, animal data strongly implicate it. Reports of interaction effects between hyperoxia and both mechanical ventilation and host defense suggest that clinical studies of hyperoxia must take these variables into account. Accumulating data about how hyperoxia initiates cell death provide guidance for development of both biomarkers to identify hyperoxia-induced injury and pharmacological interventions to limit hyperoxia's adverse effects.},

abstract={Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

The standardization by the OPS-301 is limited to inpatients. In outpatient care, surgical procedures are coded by two billing systems: EBM and GOA. Thus, the situation is characterized by coding systems that are used in parallel which are to some extent incompatible. This leads to avoidable workload and lower quality of the documented data. The general goal is the development of a new classification system which on the one hand should be able to provide different views depending on the questions. On the other hand the system should integrate the different views through a clear and consistent structure of surgical procedures.},

abstract={Oxygen (O(2)) is life essential but as a drug has a maximum positive biological benefit and accompanying toxicity effects. Oxygen is therapeutic for treatment of hypoxemia and hypoxia associated with many pathological processes. Pathophysiological processes are associated with increased levels of hyperoxia-induced reactive O(2) species (ROS) which may readily react with surrounding biological tissues, damaging lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Protective antioxidant defenses can become overwhelmed with ROS leading to oxidative stress. Activated alveolar capillary endothelium is characterized by increased adhesiveness causing accumulation of cell populations such as neutrophils, which are a source of ROS. Increased levels of ROS cause hyperpermeability, coagulopathy, and collagen deposition as well as other irreversible changes occurring within the alveolar space. In hyperoxia, multiple signaling pathways determine the pulmonary cellular response: apoptosis, necrosis, or repair. Understanding the effects of O(2) administration is important to prevent inadvertent alveolar damage caused by hyperoxia in patients requiring supplemental oxygenation.},

pages={806-812},
abstract={BACKGROUND: Existing methods allow prediction of Pa(Oâ‚‚) during adjustment of Fi(Oâ‚‚). However, these are cumbersome and lack sufficient accuracy for use in the clinical setting. The present studies aim to extend the validity of a novel formula designed to predict Pa(Oâ‚‚) during adjustment of Fi(Oâ‚‚) and to compare it with the current methods. METHODS: Sixty-seven new data sets were collected from 46 randomly selected, mechanically ventilated patients. Each data set consisted of two subsets (before and 20 min after Fi(Oâ‚‚) adjustment) and contained ventilator settings, pH, and arterial blood gas values. We compared the accuracy of Pa(Oâ‚‚) prediction using a new formula (which utilizes only the pre-adjustment Pa(Oâ‚‚) and pre- and post-adjustment Fi(Oâ‚‚) with prediction using assumptions of constant Pa(Oâ‚‚)/Fi(Oâ‚‚) or constant Pa(Oâ‚‚)/Pa(Oâ‚‚). Subsequently, 20 clinicians predicted Pa(Oâ‚‚) using the new formula and using Nunn's isoshunt diagram. The accuracy of the clinician's predictions was examined. RESULTS: The 95{\%} limits of agreement (LA(95{\%})) between predicted and measured Pa(Oâ‚‚) in the patient group were: new formula 0.11 (2.0) kPa, Pa(Oâ‚‚)/Fi(Oâ‚‚) -1.9 (4.4) kPa, and Pa(Oâ‚‚)/Pa(Oâ‚‚) -1.0 (3.6) kPa. The LA(95{\%}) of clinicians' predictions of Pa(Oâ‚‚) were 0.56 (3.6) kPa (new formula) and -2.7 (6.4) kPa (isoshunt diagram). CONCLUSIONS: The new formula's prediction of changes in Pa(Oâ‚‚) is acceptably accurate and reliable and better than any other existing method. Its use by clinicians appears to improve accuracy over the most popular existing method. The simplicity of the new method may allow its regular use in the critical care setting.},

Acute kidney injury was diagnosed in 19 207 of 297 554 patients (6.5{\%}), myocardial injury in 8972 of 320 527 (2.8{\%}), and lung injury in 13 789 of 312 161 (4.4{\%}). The median fraction of inspired oxygen was 54.0{\%} (interquartile range 47.5{\%}-60.0{\%}), and the area under the curve of supraphysiological inspired oxygen was 7951{\%} min (5870-11 107{\%} min), equivalent to an 80{\%} fraction of inspired oxygen throughout a 135 minute procedure, for example. After accounting for baseline covariates and other potential confounding variables, increased oxygen exposure was associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury, myocardial injury, and lung injury. Patients at the 75th centile for the area under the curve of the fraction of inspired oxygen had 26{\%} greater odds of acute kidney injury (95{\%} confidence interval 22{\%} to 30{\%}), 12{\%} greater odds of myocardial injury (7{\%} to 17{\%}), and 14{\%} greater odds of lung injury (12{\%} to 16{\%}) compared with patients at the 25th centile. Sensitivity analyses evaluating alternative definitions of the exposure, restricting the cohort, and conducting an instrumental variable analysis confirmed these observations. CONCLUSIONS: Increased supraphysiological oxygen administration during surgery was associated with a higher incidence of kidney, myocardial, and lung injury. Residual confounding of these associations cannot be excluded. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Open Science Framework osf.io/cfd2m.},

abstract={This review summarizes the (patho)-physiological effects of ventilation with high FiO2 (0.8-1.0), with a special focus on the most recent clinical evidence on its use for the management of circulatory shock and during medical emergencies. Hyperoxia is a cornerstone of the acute management of circulatory shock, a concept which is based on compelling experimental evidence that compensating the imbalance between O2 supply and requirements (i.e., the oxygen dept) is crucial for survival, at least after trauma. On the other hand, "oxygen toxicity" due to the increased formation of reactive oxygen species limits its use, because it may cause serious deleterious side effects, especially in conditions of ischemia/reperfusion. While these effects are particularly pronounced during long-term administration, i.e., beyond 12-24 h, several retrospective studies suggest that even hyperoxemia of shorter duration is also associated with increased mortality and morbidity. In fact, albeit the clinical evidence from prospective studies is surprisingly scarce, a recent meta-analysis suggests that hyperoxia is associated with increased mortality at least in patients after cardiac arrest, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. Most of these data, however, originate from heterogenous, observational studies with inconsistent results, and therefore, there is a need for the results from the large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trials on the use of hyperoxia, which can be anticipated within the next 2-3 years. Consequently, until then, "conservative" O2 therapy, i.e., targeting an arterial hemoglobin O2 saturation of 88-95 {\%} as suggested by the guidelines of the ARDS Network and the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, represents the treatment of choice to avoid exposure to both hypoxemia and excess hyperoxemia.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: In the context of an ongoing debate on the potential risks of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia, it seems prudent to maintain the partial arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) in a physiological range during administration of supplemental oxygen. The PaO2 and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) are closely related and both are used to monitor oxygenation status. However, SpO2 values cannot be used as an exact substitute for PaO2. The aim of this study in acutely ill and stable patients was to determine at which SpO2 level PaO2 is more or less certain to be in the physiological range. METHODS: This is an observational study prospectively collecting data pairs of PaO2 and SpO2 values in patients admitted to the emergency room or intensive care unit (Prospective Inpatient Acutely ill cohort; PIA cohort). A second cohort of retrospective data of patients who underwent pulmonary function testing was also included (Retrospective Outpatient Pulmonary cohort; ROP cohort). Arterial hypoxemia was defined as PaO2 125 mmHg. The SpO2 cut-off values with the lowest risk of hypoxemia and hyperoxemia were determined as the 95th percentile of the observed SpO2 values corresponding with the observed hypoxemic and hyperoxemic PaO2 values. RESULTS: 220 data pairs were collected in the PIA cohort. 95{\%} of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 94{\%}, and 95{\%} of hyperoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 above 96{\%}. Additionally in the 1379 data pairs of the ROP cohort, 95{\%} of hypoxemic PaO2 measurements occurred in patients with an SpO2 below 93{\%}. CONCLUSION: The SpO2 level marking an increased risk of arterial hypoxemia is not substantially different in acutely ill versus stable patients. In acutely ill patients receiving supplemental oxygen an SpO2 target of 95{\%} maximizes the likelihood of maintaining PaO2 in the physiological range.},

abstract={The use of an inspiratory oxygen fraction of 0.80 during surgery is a topic of ongoing debate. Opponents claim that increased oxidative stress, atelectasis, and impaired oxygen delivery due to hyperoxic vasoconstriction are detrimental. Proponents point to the beneficial effects on the incidence of surgical site infections and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Also, hyperoxygenation is thought to extend the safety margin in case of acute intraoperative emergencies. This review provides a comprehensive risk-benefit analysis for the use of perioperative hyperoxia in noncritically ill adults based on clinical evidence and supported by physiological deduction where needed. Data from the field of hyperbaric medicine, as a model of extreme hyperoxygenation, are extrapolated to the perioperative setting. We ultimately conclude that current evidence is in favour of hyperoxia in noncritically ill intubated adult surgical patients.},

abstract={Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is a well known consequence of cardiac arrest. Variable injuries can occur with purely hypoxic or histotoxic insults such as asphyxiation and carbon monoxide poisoning. The injury may happen at the time of the insult, but there may also be continued damage after circulation and oxygenation are reestablished. The nature and extent of the damage appears to depend on the severity, time course and duration of the oxygen deprivation and lack of blood supply, as well as on the underlying mechanism. This review describes the pathophysiological and molecular basis of hypoxic ischemic brain injury, and differentiates between the mechanisms of injury by cardiac arrest, pure respiratory arrest, and arrest secondary to cytotoxicity (e.g. carbon monoxide poisoning).},

abstract={BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Assessment of oxygenation in patients with community-acquired pneumonia is critical for treatment. The accuracy of percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO2 ) determined by pulse oximetry is uncertain, and it has limited value in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. We hypothesized that calculation of partial arterial oxygen concentration/inspired oxygen faction (PaO2 /FiO2 ) from SpO2 by the Ellis or Rice equations might adequately correlate with PaO2 /FiO2 measured by arterial blood gases. METHODS: We studied 1004 patients with pneumonia in the emergency department with simultaneous measurement of SpO2 and PaO2 from two cohorts from Valencia, Spain and Utah, USA. We compared SpO2 with measured SaO2 , compared the equations' accuracy in calculating PaO2 /FiO2 and determined how often patients would be misclassified at clinically important thresholds. We compared estimated PaO2 /FiO2 to measured PaO2 /FiO2 using the Spearman correlation. RESULTS: Pairwise correlation of SpO2 with SaO2 was moderate (rho = 0.66; P < 0.01). Both equations performed similarly among patients with lower PaO2 /FiO2 ratios. The Ellis equation estimated PaO2 /FiO2 from SpO2 more accurately than the Rice equation in patients with PaO2 /FiO2 â‰¥200. Simple agreement between calculated and measured P/F was 91{\%} and 92{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Ellis equation was more accurate than the Rice equation for estimating PaO2 /FiO2 , especially at higher levels of P/F ratio. Estimation of PaO2 /FiO2 from SpO2 is accurate enough for initial oxygenation assessment. Ellis and Rice equations could misclassify 20{\%} and 30{\%} of patients, respectively, at higher levels of PaO2 /FiO2 . For patients with abnormal oxygenation falling near thresholds for clinical decision making, arterial blood gas measurement preferably on room air is more accurate.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: The ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen is a key component of the sequential organ failure assessment score that operationally defines sepsis. But, it is calculated infrequently due to the need for the acquisition of an arterial blood gas. So, we sought to find an optimal imputation strategy for the estimation of sepsis-defining hypoxemic respiratory failure using oximetry instead of an arterial blood gas. APPROACH: We retrospectively studied a sample of non-intubated acute-care patients with oxygen saturation recorded â©½10 min before arterial blood sampling (N = 492 from 2013-2017). We imputed ratios of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen and sepsis criteria from existing imputation equations (Hill, Severinghaus-Ellis, Rice, and Pandharipande) and compared them with the ratios and sepsis criteria measured from arterial blood gases. We devised a modified model-based equation to eliminate the bias of the results. MAIN RESULTS: Hypoxemia severity estimates from the Severinghaus-Ellis equation were more accurate than those from other existing equations, but showed significant proportional bias towards under-estimation of hypoxemia severity, especially at oxygen saturations >96{\%}. Our modified equation eliminated bias and surpassed others on all imputation quality metrics. SIGNIFICANCE: Our modified imputation equation, [Formula: see text] is the first one that is free of bias at all oxygen saturations. It resulted in ratios of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen and sepsis respiratory criteria closest to those obtained by arterial blood gas testing and is the optimal imputation strategy for non-intubated acute-care patients.},

STUDY DESIGN: SpO2 was maintained at 90{\%}, 92{\%}, 94{\%}, 96{\%}, and 98{\%} by adjustment of FiO2. PaO2 was correlated with SpO2 by nonlinear mixed effects regression analysis. RESULTS: PaO2(y) correlated positively with SpO2(x): y = (0.03). e0.08(x). Variation of PaO2 increased from a range of +/- 10 Torr at SpO2 = 90{\%} to +/- 28 Torr at SpO2 = 98{\%}, principally as a result of decreasing hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, with no effect of advancing gestational age, subject temperature, pH, PaCO2. Considerable time (18 +/- 14 SD minutes) and effort (5 +/- 3 SD FiO2 adjustments/min were required to achieve and maintain a desired SpO2.

abstract={BACKGROUND: ARDS is an important clinical problem. The definition of ARDS requires testing of arterial blood gas to define the ratio of Pao2 to Fio2 (Pao2/Fio2 ratio). However, many patients with ARDS do not undergo blood gas measurement, which may result in underdiagnosis of the condition. As a consequence, a method for estimating Pao2 on the basis of noninvasive measurements is desirable. METHODS: Using data from three ARDS Network studies, we analyzed the enrollment arterial blood gas measurements to compare nonlinear with linear and log-linear imputation methods of estimating Pao2 from percent saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen as measured by pulse oximetry (Spo2). We compared mortality on the basis of various measured and imputed Pao2/Fio2 ratio cutoffs to ensure clinical equivalence. RESULTS: We studied 1,184 patients, in 707 of whom the Spo2 â‰¤ 96{\%}. Nonlinear imputation from the Spo2/Fio2 ratio resulted in lower error than linear or log-linear imputation (P < .001) for patients with Spo2 â‰¤ 96{\%} but was equivalent to log-linear imputation in all patients. Ninety-day hospital mortality was 26{\%} to 30{\%}, depending on the Pao2/Fio2 ratio, whether nonlinearly imputed or measured. On multivariate regression, the association between imputed and measured Pao2 varied by use of vasopressors and Spo2. CONCLUSIONS: A nonlinear equation more accurately imputes Pao2/Fio2 from Spo2/Fio2 than linear or log-linear equations, with similar observed hospital mortality depending on Spo2/Fio2 ratio vs measured Pao2/Fio2 ratios. While further refinement through prospective validation is indicated, a nonlinear imputation appears superior to prior approaches to imputation.},

abstract={Background: The objective of this study was to identify the correlation between arterial blood gas (ABG) hemoglobin and venous hemoglobin in acutely ill patients. Methods: This was a prospective observational study on ABG and venous hemoglobin in samples drawn from 103 (59 males and 44 females) patients who presented to acute care areas like emergency room and intensive care units of a quaternary care center. ABG hemoglobin was estimated from point of care testing and venous hemoglobin was obtained from the sample sent to the laboratory. The data were entered into a specifically designed database and analyzed statistically by statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 20. Results: Although there were some serious pathological involvement and associated comorbidities, statistical analysis on correlation between ABG and venous hemoglobin showed a strong positive correlation between ABG and venous hemoglobin (P < 0.01). Conclusion: ABG analysis of hemoglobin could be considered as an alternate tool for hemoglobin quantification, except in rarest scenarios that require a precise estimation of hemoglobin concentration. We also conclude that rapid estimation of hemoglobin by ABG analysis would enhance diagnostic approaches and prognostic aspects of critically ill patients.

abstract={Background and Purpose- The prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients may be useful in treatment decisions. Machine learning techniques are being increasingly adapted for use in the medical field because of their high accuracy. This study investigated the applicability of machine learning techniques to predict long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients. Methods- This was a retrospective study using a prospective cohort that enrolled patients with acute ischemic stroke. Favorable outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score 0, 1, or 2 at 3 months. We developed 3 machine learning models (deep neural network, random forest, and logistic regression) and compared their predictability. To evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning models, we also compared them to the Acute Stroke Registry and Analysis of Lausanne (ASTRAL) score. Results- A total of 2604 patients were included in this study, and 2043 (78{\%}) of them had favorable outcomes. The area under the curve for the deep neural network model was significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score (0.888 versus 0.839; P<0.001), while the areas under the curves of the random forest (0.857; P=0.136) and logistic regression (0.849; P=0.413) models were not significantly higher than that of the ASTRAL score. Using only the 6 variables that are used for the ASTRAL score, the performance of the machine learning models did not significantly differ from that of the ASTRAL score. Conclusions- Machine learning algorithms, particularly the deep neural network, can improve the prediction of long-term outcomes in ischemic stroke patients.},

Numerous studies support the substitution of arterial by venous blood samples, reporting strong correlations between arterial and venous values. This study further investigated the predictive ability of venous blood samples for arterial Acid-Base Balance (pH) and pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2). Participants were 51 post-brain surgery patients receiving mechanical ventilation, who had blood samples taken simultaneously from radial artery of the wrist and elbow vein. Results showed significant associations between arterial and venous pH and pCO2. However, the variation of regression residuals was not homogenous, and the regression line did not fit properly to the data, indicating that simple linear regression is sub-optimal for prediction of arterial pH and pCO2 by venous blood sample. Although highly significant correlations were found between arterial and venous blood pH and pCO2, the results did not support the reliability of prediction of arterial blood pH and pCO2 by venous blood samples across a range of concentrations.},

abstract={Oxygen is one of the most commonly used therapeutic agents. Injudicious use of oxygen at high partial pressures (hyperoxia) for unproven indications, its known toxic potential, and the acknowledged roles of reactive oxygen species in tissue injury led to skepticism regarding its use. A large body of data indicates that hyperoxia exerts an extensive profile of physiologic and pharmacologic effects that improve tissue oxygenation, exert anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, and augment tissue repair mechanisms. These data set the rationale for the use of hyperoxia in a list of clinical conditions characterized by tissue hypoxia, infection, and consequential impaired tissue repair. Data on regional hemodynamic effects of hyperoxia and recent compelling evidence on its anti-inflammatory actions incited a surge of interest in the potential therapeutic effects of hyperoxia in myocardial revascularization and protection, in traumatic and nontraumatic ischemicanoxic brain insults, and in prevention of surgical site infections and in alleviation of septic and nonseptic local and systemic inflammatory responses. Although the margin of safety between effective and potentially toxic doses of oxygen is relatively narrow, the ability to carefully control its dose, meticulous adherence to currently accepted therapeutic protocols, and individually tailored treatment regimens make it a cost-effective safe drug.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Blood gas analysis is very important in the patients with respiratory problems. Arterial puncture may cause complications such as pain, local hematoma, infection and nerve injury. The procedure itself can be technically difficult. In contrast, venous sampling is an easier procedure with fewer complications. Therefore, this study aims to determine the possibility of replacement of venous blood gas (VBG) values by ABG values in ICU wards admitted patients. METHODS: In this study, 155 paired blood gas samples collected from patients admitted to ICU wards in Motahari hospital, Marvdasht, Fars, Iran. Statistical means of blood gas parameters, including PO2, PCO2, HCO3 and PH have been compared in both, arterial and venous, blood samples in parallel using paired t-test. RESULTS: Mean difference of arterial and venous gas parameters, PO2, PCO2 and HCO3 , was significantly differ. All paired gas parameters in arterial and venous blood samples were significantly correlated, while this correlation was stronger between PCO2 and HCO3. CONCLUSION: To predict the arterial blood gas parameters from VBG parameters, single regression models are of more statistical value compared to multiple regression models. Defined single regression prediction models could be used to predict arterial PCO2 and HCO3 , which may reduce arterial sampling in ICU wards.},

abstract={The different versions of autologous blood transfusion have rekindled interest in a generally valid 'minimum acceptable hemoglobin concentration' of patients around or below 10 g Hb/dl. The adequate Hb concentration capable of covering the oxygen demands of the body depends on several variables measurable at the bedside: oxygen consumption VO2, arterial oxygen tension paO2, body temperature, arterial and mixed venous pH, and cardiac output CO as the most important compensatory variable in anemia. Because of the strain imposed on the myocardium and the coronary circulation, anemia should not raise CO to more than twice the resting value, i.e. less than 10 l/min. Similarly, the mixed venous pO2, as an indicator of tissue oxygenation, should not fall below 35 mm Hg. With these two restrictions, we studied the relationships of the above-mentioned parameters in a computer-supported model. Under otherwise similar conditions, pvO2 falls with an increase in VO2, a decrease in paO2, a decrease in the temperature, an increase in pH, and a decrease in CO. A resting and slightly acidotic patient without other impediments of his cellular oxygen supply--e.g. the patient on chronic hemodialysis--tolerates a Hb level of 6-7 g/dl with a pvO2 barely exceeding 35 mm Hg and a CO approximately 50{\%} above baseline. By contrast, the hypermetabolic and hypoxemic intensive care patient needs Hb levels in the low normal range, i.e. 12-13 g/dl, especially if he is also alkalotic. A generally valid 'minimum acceptable hemoglobin level' does not exist; the adequate Hb concentration is an individual characteristic needing careful attention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract={The current practice of mechanical ventilation comprises the use of the least inspiratory O2 fraction associated with an arterial O2 tension of 55 to 80 mm Hg or an arterial hemoglobin O2 saturation of 88{\%} to 95{\%}. Early goal-directed therapy for septic shock, however, attempts to balance O2 delivery and demand by optimizing cardiac function and hemoglobin concentration, without making use of hyperoxia. Clearly, it has been well-established for more than a century that long-term exposure to pure O2 results in pulmonary and, under hyperbaric conditions, central nervous O2 toxicity. Nevertheless, several arguments support the use of ventilation with 100{\%} O2 as a supportive measure during the first 12 to 24 hrs of septic shock. In contrast to patients without lung disease undergoing anesthesia, ventilation with 100{\%} O2 does not worsen intrapulmonary shunt under conditions of hyperinflammation, particularly when low tidal volume-high positive end-expiratory pressure ventilation is used. In healthy volunteers and experimental animals, exposure to hyperoxia may cause pulmonary inflammation, enhanced oxidative stress, and tissue apoptosis. This, however, requires long-term exposure or injurious tidal volumes. In contrast, within the timeframe of a perioperative administration, direct O2 toxicity only plays a negligible role. Pure O2 ventilation induces peripheral vasoconstriction and thus may counteract shock-induced hypotension and reduce vasopressor requirements. Furthermore, in experimental animals, a redistribution of cardiac output toward the kidney and the hepato-splanchnic organs was observed. Hyperoxia not only reverses the anesthesia-related impairment of the host defense but also is an antibiotic. In fact, perioperative hyperoxia significantly reduced wound infections, and this effect was directly related to the tissue O2 tension. Therefore, we advocate mechanical ventilation with 100{\%} O2 during the first 12 to 24 hrs of septic shock. However, controlled clinical trials are mandatory to test the safety and efficacy of this approach.},

title={Nonlinear Imputation of PaO2/FIO2 From SpO2/FIO2 Among Mechanically Ventilated Patients in the ICU: A Prospective, Observational Study},
journal={Critical care medicine},

month={Aug},
volume={45},
number={8},
pages={1317-1324},
abstract={OBJECTIVES: In the contemporary ICU, mechanically ventilated patients may not have arterial blood gas measurements available at relevant timepoints. Severity criteria often depend on arterial blood gas results. Retrospective studies suggest that nonlinear imputation of PaO2/FIO2 from SpO2/FIO2 is accurate, but this has not been established prospectively among mechanically ventilated ICU patients. The objective was to validate the superiority of nonlinear imputation of PaO2/FIO2 among mechanically ventilated patients and understand what factors influence the accuracy of imputation. DESIGN: Simultaneous SpO2, oximeter characteristics, receipt of vasopressors, and skin pigmentation were recorded at the time of a clinical arterial blood gas. Acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria were recorded. For each imputation method, we calculated both imputation error and the area under the curve for patients meeting criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FIO2 â‰¤ 300) and moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FIO2 â‰¤ 150). SETTING: Nine hospitals within the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury network. PATIENTS: We prospectively enrolled 703 mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the emergency departments or ICUs of participating study hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We studied 1,034 arterial blood gases from 703 patients; 650 arterial blood gases were associated with SpO2 less than or equal to 96{\%}. Nonlinear imputation had consistently lower error than other techniques. Among all patients, nonlinear had a lower error (p < 0.001) and higher (p < 0.001) area under the curve (0.87; 95{\%} CI, 0.85-0.90) for PaO2/FIO2 less than or equal to 300 than linear/log-linear (0.80; 95{\%} CI, 0.76-0.83) imputation. All imputation methods better identified moderate-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2/FIO2 â‰¤ 150); nonlinear imputation remained superior (p < 0.001). For PaO2/FIO2 less than or equal to 150, the sensitivity and specificity for nonlinear imputation were 0.87 (95{\%} CI, 0.83-0.90) and 0.91 (95{\%} CI, 0.88-0.93), respectively. Skin pigmentation and receipt of vasopressors were not associated with imputation accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: In mechanically ventilated patients, nonlinear imputation of PaO2/FIO2 from SpO2/FIO2 seems accurate, especially for moderate-severe hypoxemia. Linear and log-linear imputations cannot be recommended.},

number={1},
pages={67-76},
abstract={BACKGROUND: Intraoperative oxygen management is poorly understood. It was hypothesized that potentially preventable hyperoxemia and substantial oxygen exposure would be common during general anesthesia. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted to describe current ventilator management, particularly oxygen management, during general anesthesia in Japan. All adult patients (16 yr old or older) who received general anesthesia over 5 consecutive days in 2015 at 43 participating hospitals were identified. Ventilator settings and vital signs were collected 1 h after the induction of general anesthesia. We determined the prevalence of potentially preventable hyperoxemia (oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry of more than 98{\%}, despite fractional inspired oxygen tension of more than 0.21) and the risk factors for potentially substantial oxygen exposure (fractional inspired oxygen tension of more than 0.5, despite oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry of more than 92{\%}). RESULTS: A total of 1,786 patients were found eligible, and 1,498 completed the study. Fractional inspired oxygen tension was between 0.31 and 0.6 in 1,385 patients (92{\%}), whereas it was less than or equal to 0.3 in very few patients (1{\%}). Most patients (83{\%}) were exposed to potentially preventable hyperoxemia, and 32{\%} had potentially substantial oxygen exposure. In multivariable analysis, old age, emergency surgery, and one-lung ventilation were independently associated with increased potentially substantial oxygen exposure, whereas use of volume control ventilation and high positive end-expiratory pressure levels were associated with decreased potentially substantial oxygen exposure. One-lung ventilation was particularly a strong risk factor for potentially substantial oxygen exposure (adjusted odds ratio, 13.35; 95{\%} CI, 7.24 to 24.60). CONCLUSIONS: Potentially preventable hyperoxemia and substantial oxygen exposure are common during general anesthesia, especially during one-lung ventilation. Future research should explore the safety and feasibility of a more conservative approach for intraoperative oxygen therapy.},

Venous and arterial blood samples were collected from 132 patients. Using the data of 106 patients, the ANNs were trained and validated by back-propagation algorithm. Subsequently, data from the remainder 26 patients was used for testing the networks. The ability of ANNs to predict ABG values and to detect significant hypercarbia was assessed and the results were compared with a linear regression model. Our results indicate that the ANNs provide an accurate method for predicting ABG values from VBG values and detecting hypercarbia in AECOPD.},

abstract={OBJECTIVE: Accurate measurement of surgical outcomes is highly desirable to optimize surgical decision-making. An important element of surgical decision making is identification of the patient cohort that will benefit from surgery before the intervention. Machine learning (ML) enables computers to learn from previous data to make accurate predictions on new data. In this systematic review, we evaluate the potential of ML for neurosurgical outcome prediction. METHODS: A systematic search in the PubMed and Embase databases was performed to identify all potential relevant studies up to January 1, 2017. RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified that evaluated ML algorithms used as prediction models for survival, recurrence, symptom improvement, and adverse events in patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy, brain tumor, spinal lesions, neurovascular disease, movement disorders, traumatic brain injury, and hydrocephalus. Depending on the specific prediction task evaluated and the type of input features included, ML models predicted outcomes after neurosurgery with a median accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 94.5{\%} and 0.83, respectively. Compared with logistic regression, ML models performed significantly better and showed a median absolute improvement in accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve of 15{\%} and 0.06, respectively. Some studies also demonstrated a better performance in ML models compared with established prognostic indices and clinical experts. CONCLUSIONS: In the research setting, ML has been studied extensively, demonstrating an excellent performance in outcome prediction for a wide range of neurosurgical conditions. However, future studies should investigate how ML can be implemented as a practical tool supporting neurosurgical care.},
